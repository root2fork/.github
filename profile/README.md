Agroforestry systems, which introduce trees into agricultural fields, have been argued to comprise one of the most advanced and
effective forms of regenerative agriculture. Despite this, practioners have identified the following needs: i) how to reduce labor costs
while maximizing productivity, ii) what to plant beneath and between tree rows and (iii) how to reconcile ecological regulations with
economic realities. To address this, our consortium will test the influence of different shrubs and shade-tolerant herbaceous perennials - such as kale, spinach or rocket- within apple or quince orchards, to form multi-strata agroforestry systems.
